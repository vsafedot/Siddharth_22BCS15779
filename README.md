Welcome to the official repository for AP. This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems, primarily focused on data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific problem. Below is an overview of the included problems:

- **3Sum**: Solution to the 3Sum problem.
- **Contains Duplicate**: Checks for duplicate elements in a list.
- **Jump Game**: Determines if you can reach the last index of an array.
- **Jump Game 2**: Finds the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.
- **Majority Element**: Identifies the majority element in an array.
- **Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array**: Removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place.
- **Set Matrix Zero**: Sets entire row and column to zero if an element is zero.
- **Two Sum**: Finds indices of two numbers that add up to a specific target.
- **Valid Palindrome**: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- **Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List**: Deletes the middle node from a linked list.
- **Find the Duplicate Number**: Finds the duplicate number in an array.
- **Linked List Cycle**: Detects if a linked list has a cycle.
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Merge k Sorted Lists**: Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Merges two sorted linked lists into one.
- **Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II**: Removes all elements that have duplicates from a sorted list.
- **Reverse Linked List II**: Reverses a linked list from position m to n.
- **Rotate List**: Rotates a linked list to the right by k places.
- **Sort List**: Sorts a linked list in O(n log n) time.

Each directory contains the solution code and any associated resources or documentation.
